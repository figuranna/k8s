    * Automatically creates a new pod if one crashes and stops
    * The downside is that there is no instance for that pod, there'll be downtime
    * There can be many replicas, we need to figure out how much replicas we need for a microservice
        * The different replicas will be running on different computers (in our case it runs on the same)
